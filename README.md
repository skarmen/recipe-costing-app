## Recipe Costing App
A web app that takes the user's input and generates recipe costing sheets in Google Sheets. The app renders selected information from the Google Sheets (e.g ingredients, recipe groups, units). This repository has a ready-to-copy-paste google sheet template that you need to run the application.
Currently the app is compatible only with Google Chrome.

## Motivation
After I graduated from Udacity's Intro to Programming Nanodegree I decided to practice my newly acquired skills by building something simple and useful that can automate some of the most repetitive tasks at my job. This is how I came up with the idea to automate the recipe costing process with an existing Google Sheets database.
I am thrilled that my first made-from-scratch project is already deployed and used by my co-workers.

## Demo
![Recipe Costing App Demo](demo/app-demo-fast.gif)

## Built with
  - Python
  - JavaScript
  - Flask
  - gspread
  - HTML
  - CSS
  - Bootstrap

## Features
This application makes it easy to:
  - Efficiently cost recipes
  - Generate Google Sheets with the provided templates and create a more organized and consistent database for your costing needs
  - Select ingredients directly from the database in Google Sheets
  - Add new ingredients & recipe groups (sheets) directly from the web portal
  - Restrict access to specific users with the authentication feature


## Installation & Usage
 **To Install**

```$ git clone https://github.com/skarmen/recipe-costing-app/```

**To Run**
```
$ cd recipe-costing-app
$ python3 wsgi.py
```

## Setup

**I. Set up your Google Sheet**

   1. Get the Google Sheet template [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1MuhTdjDZ0N3soA6olJ68aufQbpo5-fZzQgc5v-M-K6s/edit?usp=sharing)
   2. Make a copy of the template and add it you Google Drive
   3. Rename your new file as you wish & start adding ingredients and categories to it
   4. Go to the ***spreadsheet.py*** file, find the variable ***SHEET_NAME*** and assigned it your new spreadsheet name (e.g     ***SHEET_NAME = “My Recipe Costing App”***). You will need to repeat this step every time the spreadsheet name is changed.
   5. Changes to the Google Sheet
      - **Important Dependencies**
          - Column *PRICE* at *CATEGORY* row, in *INGREDIENT COST* sheet it should be empty at all times
          - Submitted ingredients will be added as an ingredient after the last *empty line* in *INGREDIENT COST* sheet. Recommend creating a category at the end of the sheet named "Recipes from the portal"
          - If you need to rename the pre-existing sheet names (e.g *INGREDIENT COST*, *recipe-template*) they must be changed throughout ***spreadsheet.py***.
          - **Any other changes to the pre-existing sheet templates will cause the app to break**


**II. Google Sheet Authentication**

Once you have set up the recipe template sheet you need to configure your Google Sheet Authentication.
To programmatically access your spreadsheet, you will need to create a service account and credentials from the [Google APIs console](https://console.developers.google.com/apis/).

   1. Go to the [Google APIs console](https://console.developers.google.com/apis/)
   2. Create a new project
   3. Click ***Enable APIs and Services*** , search for and enable Google Drive API
   4. Go to ***Credentials > Create Credentials > Help Me choose***
   5. Select the following: (credentials for a ***Web Server*** to access ***Application Data***)
       - ***Google Drive API***
       - ***Web Server (e.g node.js, Tomcat)***
       - ***Application Data***
       - ***No, I’m not using them***
  6. Create a name for the service account and grant it a ***Project*** Role of ***Editor***
  7. Download the JSON file
  8. Rename the file to *client_secret.json* and copy it to your code directory
  9. Find the *client_email* inside the *client_secret.json* and copy the email
  10. Go to your spreadsheet and click the ***Share*** button and paste the client email & send it. This will give the app edit rights for that sheet.

With all credentials in place, there is one last step to set up your google sheet with the app.

**III. HTTP Authentication**

You can grant access to the web application by creating ***.env** file in the main directory. This is only basic HTTP auth with Flask.
  1. In the main directory create ***.env** file
  2. Follow this format
  ```
  RECIPE_USER=username
  RECIPE_PASSWORD=password
  ```

With all the credentials in place, you can now run the application.
